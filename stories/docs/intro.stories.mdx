# Slate Plugins Next

[Slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/) is a completely
customizable framework for building rich text editors. However, your
codebase can quickly get complex when implementing tens of features.
Built on top of Slate, `slate-plugins-next` enables you to use a list of
configurable and extendable plugins to keep your codebase clean and easy
to debug.


This library comes with a lot of plugins for the elements, marks,
deserialization, normalization, and so on. We also provide a bunch of
helpers on top of Slate's API.

[Try out the existing ones](https://slate-plugins-next.netlify.app/?path=/story/plugins-playground--plugins)
