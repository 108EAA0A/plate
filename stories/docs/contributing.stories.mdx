## 👏 Contributing

You can use this repository to **share your own plugins**.

If your plugin is _tree-shakeable_, you can add it to `packages/slate-plugins`.

Otherwise, create a new package in `packages`

📥 Pull requests and 🌟 Stars are always welcome.

### Development scripts

Useful scripts include:

#### `yarn`

> Installs package dependencies

#### `yarn storybook`

> Starts storybook dev

#### `yarn lint`

> boolean check if code conforms to linting eslint rules

#### `yarn release`

> Lint, build and push a release to git and npm will ask for version in interactive mode - using lerna.

## 📝 Notice

For simplicity, a single package `slate-plugins-next` has been published to share all the plugins.
It's not a problem as it is [tree-shakeable](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=slate-plugins-next). However, a few plugins use external dependencies.
These should be moved into their own package.
