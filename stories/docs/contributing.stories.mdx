## üìù Notice

### Why

[Slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate) is a powerful editor framework that helps you deal with
difficult parts when building an editor, such as events handlers, elements, formatting, commands, rendering,
serializing, normalizing, etc.

While you are trying to build your own editors, it still need a lot of efforts to make something
similar to [Quill](https://quilljs.com/) or [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/).
This repository allows you to build your editor right away with **minimal** slate knowledge.

### Bundle size

For simplicity, a single package `slate-plugins-next` has been published to share all the plugins.
It's not a problem as [it is tree-shakeable](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=slate-plugins-next). However, a few plugins use external dependencies.
These should be moved into their own package in the future.
