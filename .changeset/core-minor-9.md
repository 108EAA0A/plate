`SlatePlugin`: the previous plugin could implement the following
handlers: `onChange`, `onDOMBeforeInput` and `onKeyDown`. The plugins
now implement all DOM handlers: clipboard, composition, focus, form,
image, keyboard, media, mouse, selection, touch, pointer, ui, wheel
animation and transition events.
